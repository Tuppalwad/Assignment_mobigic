Hello dear sir,

As per your requirements, I have successfully completed the assignment using the following technology stack:

1) React Js (Front-end)
2) Bootstrap (CSS Framework)
3) Node.js (Back-end)
4) MongoDB (Database for signup and profile information)
5) Appwrite (Storage for images)

Steps to run the app:

1) Clone the app using the GitHub repository: "https://github.com/Tuppalwad/Assignment_mobigic.git"
2) Navigate to the 'my-app' directory and run the command 'npm install'.
3) Navigate to the 'server' directory and run the command 'npm install'.

4) Start the app using the command 'npm start' for the front end and 'node index.js' for the backend.
5) Sign up, then login, and use the app.

Now you can follow these steps to run and use the application.

Thank you!
